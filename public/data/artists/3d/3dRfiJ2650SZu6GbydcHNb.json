After getting his start in television in the late '50s, Williams worked more steadily on feature films by the early '70s, impressing with his stirring orchestral scores for blockbuster disaster films like The Poseidon Adventure (1972), Earthquake (1974), and The Towering Inferno (1974), as well as through his work with such emerging directors as Robert Altman (1973's The Long Goodbye) and Steven Spielberg (1974's The Sugarland Express).","gallery":["6a9431e000404c20c36a2be94bf962002844b39f","ab6772690000dd222f65db4fabf5c396f1873065","ab6772690000dd22184e961ddf3652786e1210bf","89d577ff459abb227a7e36a4561fccd50475ba3a"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-11-25",13170494,1616290,null],["2025-11-26",13457988,1616808,null]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["4tHqQMWSqmL6YjXwsqthDI","Carol of the Bells (From \"Home Alone\" Soundtrack)",393130485,"ab67616d00001e02f497846e25233023ca7cb8b1","526351cb845f38fab35a356fa9f91f1853bacc1d","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USSM19912814","Masterworks","1990","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/3d689caef81b42fd90d35f245d5c6ce1.cnvs.mp4"],["1FlxqJmoZWS2q1uRlyZVur","Main Title \"Somewhere in My Memory\" (From \"Home Alone\" Soundtrack)",60675340,"ab67616d00001e02f497846e25233023ca7cb8b1","eef184e93237520cd17936d692339470c655985e","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USSM19909870","Masterworks","1990","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/a9bab6d827ef4c9b8c6a62f983a6047b.cnvs.mp4"],["1n8NKQRg8LVHy7oUhUgbFF","Hedwig's Theme",97645939,"ab67616d00001e0213f982aa5c43146c3d2c1964","1716237b40d951c7dd8abdca7fdc5afaf47560fb","Warner Music Group","zxx","USAT20109275","Atlantic Records","2001-10-30",null],["1ghlpxVfPbFH2jenrv9vVw","Duel of the Fates",143455712,"ab67616d00001e028b344822c35025ba9439f004","b3292ce2b613db3bc07369e52cd1688891ba486d","Universal Music Group","la","USWD11785380","Walt Disney Records","1999-05-04",null],["2TZbQZXOuR8osP2AK8yYMN","Theme From Jurassic Park",103745266,"ab67616d00001e0292f051ce3c585b5c2db21d52","e7935f96047ac595c3ae419945864e030b1c2201","Universal Music Group","zxx","USMC19340943","Geffen*","1993-05-25",null],["11Hq1xTlR8Bgm3Pgv9EqGs","O Holy Night (From \"Home Alone\" Soundtrack)",34868734,"ab67616d00001e02f497846e25233023ca7cb8b1","2e83a9bee9468de6d1922d4e0cc917587ff6854a","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USSM19912813","Masterworks","1990","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/f39fe05320e841f6a8d90360e754dc01.cnvs.mp4"],["3rUMH7i22tlkymhDPOmXUv","Across the Stars (Love Theme from \"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones\")",83888127,"ab67616d00001e023eeec51271e95760c82324f3","24e6552b50b4dc6cb54958991a6b41dca9c7c09c","Universal Music Group","zxx","USWD11785324","Walt Disney Records","2002-04-23",null],["6CeCOC2zx1qS8mQNYHe6IM","Prologue",84212439,"ab67616d00001e0213f982aa5c43146c3d2c1964","536b41d94717400695300329b7b63ef74dd9c332","Warner Music Group","en","USAT20109180","Atlantic Records","2001-10-30",null],["1WA5av9UlqPNOKcaUdWbGM","Somewhere in My Memory (From \"Home Alone\" Soundtrack) - Chorus & Orchestra Version",38449383,"ab67616d00001e02f497846e25233023ca7cb8b1","03fdb11367f106ae0427c1be39d0711049f02354","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USSM19912817","Masterworks","1990","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/67ddaf21d2b846a899b77314229ebbc8.cnvs.mp4"],["42gZM6AQ9BDMaTyTmMDVlN","Theme From Schindler's List",95854757,"ab67616d00001e02112179621605b07a1f3ff957","105596845769eb2ac462b3713f24e96fc59ba373","Universal Music Group","zxx","USMC19341929","Geffen*","1993-01-01",null],["2bw4WgXyXP90hIex7ur58y","The Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)",83658350,"ab67616d00001e021e869a1d333210eaa2bfe670","82c11d60cf0ab4e682a4abfac979a79d4c4e3520","Universal Music Group","zxx","USWD11785366","Walt Disney Records","1980-01-01",null]]},"topCities":{"fields":["cid","l"],"rows":[[1001,265972],[1000,120163],[1013,119986],[1014,105283],[1081,102538]]},"relatedArtists":[]}
