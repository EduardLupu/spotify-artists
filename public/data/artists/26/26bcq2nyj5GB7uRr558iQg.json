Survivor was founded in 1978 by guitarist/keyboardist Jim Peterik (formerly the lead singer of the Ides of March ) with guitarist Frankie Sullivan; the two recruited lead singer Dave Bickler and recorded a self-titled debut album as a trio with studio musicians Dennis Johnson on bass and Gary Smith on drums.","gallery":["4b664fd84812a6275249447cae61ca048721c52d","fdf2d577ecdde02b67d987202ff0ffbb0b439d99","c125169c764be8daba897aa896c0c9ded19600bd","1d1740486c78d732f5807d19f908f9a44c211d70","0f0f41e4657ab3c8d4c7c0809cc1f02b84401b69","0c25f2c580652dd199f18b6ad4724275a770b14d"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-10-25",13225024,1401043,null],["2025-10-26",13279463,1401716,null]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["28P5HAF0Kll9Xd9dX4qw7A","Eye of the Tiger",1655135641,"ab67616d00001e0228c091d788ec5126817dc07a","a25804a7e4201e835716a92445f8d9b78002e22c","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USVR19300001","Volcano","1982",null],["2VN7uPrbryJ7nE2MXX3f9a","Burning Heart - From \"Rocky IV\" Soundtrack",356591185,"ab67616d00001e024ea1fd36ef7d78214011371c","9298f509bca051e0a55e20fb105d58f8f6123090","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USVR19300003","Volcano","1993-01-01",null],["3y7j9iz5XfbDOySTspM4Ss","The Search Is Over",83451200,"ab67616d00001e025b2372295e7ba9ae9a460379","fc0a01cc057e455aee015a26f8cd6cdffc921107","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USVR19600004","Volcano","1984-01-01",null],["6hQPR6kNQ98TdHGXjhK5As","Ever Since the World Began",50617497,"ab67616d00001e0228c091d788ec5126817dc07a","2b083afd6a5e726e2d2e99a1a0a323041238a03e","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USVR19600016","Volcano","1982",null],["46NtQJH1eok28bucLlHqQT","I Can't Hold Back",43293073,"ab67616d00001e022d5c6371354c6c2bc24648b5","893f8c0a6097efd333a67c9ed38293a9f2c76294","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USVR19600001","Volcano","1984-01-01",null],["0kly0FygSDXVbvbXxsZ31S","High on You",29479149,"ab67616d00001e022d5c6371354c6c2bc24648b5","503a6b21f4d4644d50c746a1492d276c26620e6b","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USVR19600002","Volcano","1984-01-01",null],["0r02aCNepGuuVHQfG0v1jB","The Moment Of The Truth",11531105,"ab67616d00001e025631dff79dceb723ab1e680d","4450e5461f15bcec469820ed4e92f4a8585c5fe6","Universal Music Group","en","USUM71012034","Island Def Jam","1984",null],["156zRgKOtm3Q3e2XV6UYjy","Eye of the Tiger - 2006 Master",26212145,"ab67616d00001e0209a9e2412ca6da022528ca0a","a31617de3207a3794fa8d49a172ef8784ddf6d76","CD Baby","en","uscgh0675308","Rude Music","2006-01-01",null],["6rt4FH5qFgXGmyhgKmlJcL","Is This Love",14562732,"ab67616d00001e0262cac2e9375e494fa580abfe","bf126a6ff0cc23e56efc1e839048779123722d2c","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USVR19200005","Volcano","1986-01-01",null],["2LEXH7ygxhkf5wqYZkEIfS","Man Against the World",15538960,"ab67616d00001e02ed09668de0bb84ad1fca49cf","e3bc5dc483059a14e66eb90476c9ac2cddc04ac2","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USVR19200006","Volcano","1986-01-01",null]]},"topCities":{"fields":["cid","l"],"rows":[[1000,313302],[1002,219043],[1007,205607],[1001,172465],[1004,121275]]},"relatedArtists":[]}
