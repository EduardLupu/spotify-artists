Yet, they became one of the most popular artists of the decade, winning four Grammy Awards, and scoring 12 Top Ten hits, and three number one singles, including the classic \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" off 1970's Close to You.","gallery":["ed45f575339b044d7168780a15ff457b85be851a","5085a4dca8586d2e1e9e1f129bdbad6485882894","faf30cbe7b4b04f3fc1a54d3de3962209e29325d","59aa35d6a09b093e9c070729dd8aca71a7546b2b","839c4c58df1204b3c2418d9f11558388cf59ee8f","269fe0f379c2345d3be9b01c701284222294e4d5","e58fdf9be52d0fa91e98020e056465b8839dfd58","ce9172748ba2d76b64464c200790950d1c44da3c","9745995042be59f6f347502ba5b95cc8605b96aa"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-12-18",13051980,3855061,null],["2025-12-19",13227788,3856104,null],["2025-12-20",13462324,3857055,null],["2025-12-21",13748840,3858127,null],["2025-12-22",14018646,3859278,null],["2025-12-23",14302016,3860349,null],["2025-12-24",14671253,3861503,null],["2025-12-25",15626036,3862846,null],["2025-12-26",16778008,3864246,null],["2025-12-27",16886464,3865358,null]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["0z5HSQGWgnjdNvwbOmhB2w","Merry Christmas Darling - Remix",164108695,"ab67616d00001e02d044360064a0177e4208a870","f8010567951c322fc8d22bb80d90cf0122de4058","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17800383","A&M","1978-10-13",null],["07RmHXaYqBdUyfAESPZkRO","Sleigh Ride",125658744,"ab67616d00001e02d044360064a0177e4208a870","ea169b73604da3bfafbb09e02540cb2e28d1b4d1","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17800377","A&M","1978-10-13",null],["07QfuFPazJYuzRtcWW0U2y","Silent Night",94261089,"ab67616d00001e02d044360064a0177e4208a870","9ce200881d8f89444b411bd5f7064ba4acf30d41","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17800393","A&M","1978-10-13",null],["2kyVQg00pphEufGT59M2XH","(They Long To Be) Close To You",282793701,"ab67616d00001e02f33f1738a2764489750e3535","4d4e5b3219e81e16f5e9e624ae1037f69711ab65","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17000373","UMC (Universal Music Catalogue)","1970-01-01",null],["3wM6RTAnF7IQpMFd7b9ZcL","Yesterday Once More",196121076,"ab67616d00001e02eafa3ccf2f56bfbb6f4f1ba5","5c985cc170a3fd9fa91484f3b88e3de0e1ab3a13","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17300051","A&M","1973-05-01",null],["7wGl806edcp34SOk5r7DEG","(There's No Place Like) Home For The Holidays",27299691,"ab67616d00001e02d044360064a0177e4208a870","92828a1c24d52fbe965fb50ef2bf5a4317c08a9b","Universal Music Group","en","USAM18400386","A&M","1978-10-13",null],["1Ehdm1PDlKrdfyBsjwEvd1","Top Of The World",202014908,"ab67616d00001e0275fc0e961ba2028df4787966","80762f7aa08153bef800c08b6b53d3a915838ec2","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17200071","A&M","1972",null],["42CX3VhPsCG75BFp07r9Vj","I Won't Last A Day Without You",124227855,"ab67616d00001e0275fc0e961ba2028df4787966","46e66e4526bf7909776350f7eb2bf81f068e0d22","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17200061","A&M","1972",null],["7xZMg363rgOR675s5uPhjL","Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas",11313070,"ab67616d00001e02d044360064a0177e4208a870","7482501e07a1e08d86cc80a30214e857abd2ef8c","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17800379","A&M","1978-10-13",null],["177bLiZAvMp5FSLQwb4iCm","Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)",10837136,"ab67616d00001e02d044360064a0177e4208a870","713219d0822bf5020b7a958e301436aeaa3f59a1","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17800381","A&M","1978-10-13",null],["0cRuocQnySYHxzgva3k2ai","Love Me For What I Am",78950447,"ab67616d00001e0230e5af0ab55dbfa49af947a2","f80fbefa93100fa04dd8edfe78a703af2b962800","Universal Music Group","en","USAM17500082","A&M","1975-06-06",null],["5cbZDpFu1hTwaU7hDQpf13","Rainy Days And Mondays",88683231,"ab67616d00001e02784643b8acf9c66f04014340","b202aeea46da9bc91b4bae5e84c7d83927aaa02e","Universal Music Group","en","USWWW0140298","A&M","1971",null]]},"topCities":{"fields":["cid","l"],"rows":[[1001,251372],[1005,215536],[1004,182371],[1013,169827],[1006,166983]]},"relatedArtists":[]}
