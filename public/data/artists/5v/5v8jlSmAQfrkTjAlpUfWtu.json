Both his early traditional crooning style plus his later relaxed manner and focus on novelty material were heavily indebted to Bing Crosby , though Como's appeal during the early '50s was virtually unrivaled.","gallery":["31a7808b0d354a5254762827ebfd2b33ac0ab12d","1f796c53df71566ed35a80799330a9a0bfe57c97","4b335307c073c6da7a5b5809ec7ce7de2a35e912","6e09f33000d2783a7059884fb14e8c3a884e1567","ea7ed79b23e0dd9b68f0252e38c3f6aa67ccaefb"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-12-03",13446837,596873,null],["2025-12-04",13959226,597255,null],["2025-12-05",14476175,597695,null],["2025-12-06",15118164,598094,null],["2025-12-07",16060115,598473,null],["2025-12-08",16894790,598830,null],["2025-12-09",17418122,599147,null],["2025-12-10",17908135,599432,null],["2025-12-11",18378832,599699,488],["2025-12-12",18857421,599949,466],["2025-12-13",19411992,600230,447],["2025-12-14",20293220,600595,413],["2025-12-15",21088394,600931,392],["2025-12-16",21528303,601198,382],["2025-12-17",21989392,601477,365],["2025-12-18",22477029,601735,351],["2025-12-19",23017446,602030,344]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["6IeK3Ap5m3HabwJxgI6eSE","It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas (with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra)",550052223,"ab67616d00001e027a5e4ed28aeceac63ae4b043","9169d12fc7219ac62773ec93247692c114531697","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC15106173","RCA Records Label","1999-08-20","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/cc5f58c57c284ff19ec1ea2d0097be8f.cnvs.mp4"],["0hvN2v6fAcB6xWyW7UaooA","(There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays -
