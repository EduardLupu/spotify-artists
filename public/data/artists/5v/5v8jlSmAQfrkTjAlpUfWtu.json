Both his early traditional crooning style plus his later relaxed manner and focus on novelty material were heavily indebted to Bing Crosby , though Como's appeal during the early '50s was virtually unrivaled.","gallery":["31a7808b0d354a5254762827ebfd2b33ac0ab12d","1f796c53df71566ed35a80799330a9a0bfe57c97","4b335307c073c6da7a5b5809ec7ce7de2a35e912","6e09f33000d2783a7059884fb14e8c3a884e1567","ea7ed79b23e0dd9b68f0252e38c3f6aa67ccaefb"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-12-03",13446837,596873,null],["2025-12-04",13959226,597255,null],["2025-12-05",14476175,597695,null],["2025-12-06",15118164,598094,null],["2025-12-07",16060115,598473,null],["2025-12-08",16894790,598830,null]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["6IeK3Ap5m3HabwJxgI6eSE","It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas (with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra)",529479272,"ab67616d00001e027a5e4ed28aeceac63ae4b043","9169d12fc7219ac62773ec93247692c114531697","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC15106173","RCA Records Label","1999-08-20","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/cc5f58c57c284ff19ec1ea2d0097be8f.cnvs.mp4"],["0hvN2v6fAcB6xWyW7UaooA","(There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays - 1959 Version",154581745,"ab67616d00001e028b73946056c94e40928046cb","05c63fcce8f011b69a083468e81233dc868a273f","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC10101096","RCA Records Label","1991-08-26","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/03fdc089e64346989e2d279381d4eaa2.cnvs.mp4"],["4LUAIXN6bpnEVaJZOLfuDt","Here We Come a-Caroling / We Wish You a Merry Christmas",104689475,"ab67616d00001e02053fc4b54c2901bb91e01229","3e2b6701693b03fe37179df7e0ef771ed295a3f7","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC10101100","RCA Records Label","1982-09-12","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/9b8dcf5a3c58426295c855dadbf62c79.cnvs.mp4"],["13F1rO6wDU481W125tkVey","Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas",27507068,"ab67616d00001e020ade6d844d8b2b341095ca47","bedb1ce1dc3f94e5ab2d175efeef3de7ce55c992","The Orchard","en","GBGVZ1011109","TV Music","2010-11-05",null],["7vuVvDFhHH3h7QyLMagBoB","Catch a Falling Star (with Mitchell Ayres and His Orchestra & The Ray Charles Singers)",88106010,"ab67616d00001e02f59578709fd742ab6a48dccb","cd15eb80f4687b33bec5d1f25204e8543c155fc4","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC15704667","Legacy Recordings","1975-09-30",null],["6x6Hn46un1jcqNrLWq29ZA","And I Love You So",42549696,"ab67616d00001e02b303898a118e4f6712630cbd","f8844ee01c50ece84f3ce77f9bf5c75c4f6b7769","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC17304670","RCA/Legacy","1973-04-12",null],["60Nn9EBZ5Ib1sL3Z9CaMJH","The Twelve Days of Christmas",13197404,"ab67616d00001e027a5e4ed28aeceac63ae4b043","c054f19921fbb3e26596d0d574000c2ac5b480cb","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC15308325","RCA Records Label","1999-08-20","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/71eb5702fbb94044b1522dd6ab623a67.cnvs.mp4"],["62eAoNfrrS84177LOzJMQx","Papa Loves Mambo",60861184,"ab67616d00001e02f59578709fd742ab6a48dccb","5d608551226ae776c0f90d719b0efc6486368b7b","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC15404658","Legacy Recordings","1975-09-30","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/ee2ee430d6764feb9bfd828bb57b18a2.cnvs.mp4"],["0W41k2j0L8tJRD9dDQaY0p","Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas",6590235,"ab67616d00001e027a5e4ed28aeceac63ae4b043","7b06c75e5581c88837c7d0fd1dbea80c8c992e03","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC16807992","RCA Records Label","1999-08-20","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/e0b314392965491a87bd3b88d014c87b.cnvs.mp4"],["6mccjzQO5BGOVLsoa77zvM","I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus",8261269,"ab67616d00001e027a5e4ed28aeceac63ae4b043","7f5e058812769c4c2b8103ee60c6b389619f4155","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC15308326","RCA Records Label","1999-08-20","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/d6f10fab15a444458979e42b699215e6.cnvs.mp4"]]},"topCities":{"fields":["cid","l"],"rows":[[1001,296355],[1013,186719],[1014,140580],[1027,135555],[1089,134188]]},"relatedArtists":[]}
