A talented and charismatic performer, Sanz proved immensely popular even with his debut album, 1991's Viviendo de Prisa, which was a number one hit in Spain.","gallery":["ab6761670000ecd43e1fc7e016c6ba5114bd561a","ab6761670000ecd4e9f2f1cbdd73094b4bdff893","ab6761670000ecd49bc6a7e9bbae7a1ec986d4a3","ab6761670000ecd4836aaad5149b7a2a486723f8","ab6761670000ecd40efde6d149135b8b1056afcd","ab6761670000ecd49d263ac1bbfdf2dc8d03a953","ab6761670000ecd4600c7d6bbc9484ac56b4a6c5","ab6761670000ecd4754d69b300f82a913f99391a"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-10-24",20925877,8393940,368],["2025-10-25",20917708,8396298,366],["2025-10-26",20895181,8398924,366],["2025-10-27",20852964,8401114,366],["2025-10-28",20825381,8403193,366],["2025-10-29",20808248,8406232,368],["2025-10-30",20826006,8407473,370]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["7klcjsUjOT35E862g1BlSC","La tortura",670502950,"ab67616d00001e02e39c5be504fdfb386d52ce63","9fda6bb43763373cf68310ece8444b65714f660f","Warner Music Group","es","USSM10501700","WM Spain","2018-04-20","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/artist/0EmeFodog0BfCgMzAIvKQp/video/211eef79d1d048039749ba1a356578aa.cnvs.mp4"],["6kQYMqjobmB8MkWwa9OUyA","Amiga mía",559704353,"ab67616d00001e023443d9c76e9713a5986c983c","2ef6ce918040a9ca70156a9d70889d39781a7203","Warner Music Group","es","ES5159706050","WM Spain","1997",null],["0wQCKR9OFjYu5Kzrk7WivJ","Corazón partío",627191582,"ab67616d00001e023443d9c76e9713a5986c983c","b4ee7371abce2a18be2094ad4093f4cc42db2ecb","Warner Music Group","es","ES5159706045","WM Spain","1997",null],["3EmjfGS6Qf5PwFhFlYsCc0","El vino de tu boca",25472100,"ab67616d00001e02e1f58d82c3ec98ac8aa11cd0","5eddaac5d3ca41968f6ee3ed8dfd401902101a8a","Sony Music Entertainment","es","ES5022501193","Sony Music Entertainment","2025-07-25",null],["3GFLbBgMuY2RELNo6tMqOS","Mi soledad y yo",247282295,"ab67616d00001e020646e298a49b0abef5decd0b","2c787b522fb2794f441d48e20a6ea7cd4aada13a","Warner Music Group","es","ES5159506013","WM Spain","1995-09-26",null],["0bZzyFUzIiqoTH744vtauR","No me tires flores",9850869,"ab67616d00001e029404c17285c3aafa17341431","c963bf3a53d001552089202798bc7c70829435cb","Sony Music Entertainment","es","ES5022501255","Sony Music Entertainment","2025-09-19","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/6c9ca8dd596f45d2b63351e7f76b77d7.cnvs.mp4"],["1DmlUpnkg4N1VWquSoffF1","Y, ¿Si fuera ella?",203686231,"ab67616d00001e023443d9c76e9713a5986c983c","2432192a5fd24c3da78d909f87f034a1b084de92","Warner Music Group","es","ES5159706043","WM Spain","1997",null],["38EI0NudWZT1qFuhEafIHh","Desde cuando",180432828,"ab67616d00001e0285427661682e66a197f951d1","d476b0752db5ac1fc0fed5680e2671d50b7b5110","Warner Music Group","es","ES5150901154","WM Spain","2009-11-10",null],["7hUJOJ6aF45Y7kbx9Xf0qX","El vino de tu boca",44397058,"ab67616d00001e028ef9ac0829a9217b3a6167ee","37eebcc57b47e8cb915d962a74117fc8f4925746","Sony Music Entertainment","es","ES5022500526","Sony Music Entertainment","2025-05-23",null],["5c1w6xM8pFvXhMXQVUY42Q","La fuerza del corazón",168136453,"ab67616d00001e020646e298a49b0abef5decd0b","7463673bf5ae23b70d34af1f0a7395007d830bc5","Warner Music Group","es","ES5159506011","WM Spain","1995-09-26",null]]},"topCities":{"fields":["cid","l"],"rows":[[1000,2611815],[1007,969654],[1030,677658],[1034,627619],[1009,606953]]},"relatedArtists":["1JbemQ1fPt2YmSLjAFhPBv","7slfeZO9LsJbWgpkIoXBUJ","7FZj349hdLfD6qzXkJLuAh","4uoz4FUMvpeyGClFTTDBsD","0UWZUmn7sybxMCqrw9tGa7","2e4nwiX8ZCU09LGLOpeqTH","7tLRDdqaS3HlX9cLbpY3Hl","5gOJTI4TusSENizxhcG7jB","2gRP1Ezbtj3qrERnd0XasU","2tY2GFdhH0Wa2VBvsxew5X","2nszmSgqreHSdJA3zWPyrW","6sq1yF0OZEWA4xoXVKW1L9","0r8toju2ecKaVtItkzAnNi","7mWCSSOYqm4E9mB7V4ot6S","7okwEbXzyT2VffBmyQBWLz","5M9Bb4adKAgrOFOhc05Y50","2AZOALDIBORfbzKTuliwdJ","368rTiMKMrz3b03az6B14w","0vR2qb8m9WHeZ5ByCbimq2","7xeM7V59cA1X8GKyKKQV87"]}
