Hall & Oates' music was remarkably well constructed and produced; at their best, their songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them, incorporating elements of new wave and hard rock.","gallery":["ab6761670000ecd46c369fba28ad93cf6a4706a2","ab6761670000ecd4f26fa7bedefc8362d954138a"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-10-24",22348183,2846137,335],["2025-10-25",22383474,2846998,333],["2025-10-26",22438840,2848054,333],["2025-10-27",22450566,2849036,333],["2025-10-28",22486769,2849873,331],["2025-10-29",22519833,2851040,330]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["7j74lucZ59vqN67Ipe2ZcY","Maneater",974639940,"ab67616d00001e02cfe4163cbb6d12f3ec15898e","d689e007e59681c1520d7492aa605e3e5073661d","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC10301821","RCA/Legacy","1982-10-04","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/840cc23027ea4fcb80d838680d8d84b1.cnvs.mp4"],["4o6BgsqLIBViaGVbx5rbRk","You Make My Dreams (Come True)",1302568329,"ab67616d00001e02fe1a9aa59e3c6189a09ae37a","5f096f9722067db33f1453ea8804725ca15ac5bf","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC10301828","RCA/BMG Heritage","1980","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/b4b1855d1598413dbfed945a820e86a7.cnvs.mp4"],["0qRR9d89hIS0MHRkQ0ejxX","Rich Girl",971871729,"ab67616d00001e023ebc5b9d8942069d3b920550","246e1cdfbc760791fa34b2ac697259b6c3598009","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC17607760","RCA Records Label","1976-08-01",null],["4LI7LqBRuXxLyEZ2fCQnit","Out of Touch",265343083,"ab67616d00001e020320feb23e4090969b931fac","47f902acad5dcd54b586e43b19d778e272f737b1","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC18404650","RCA Camden","2001-01-18",null],["41dDygR3r7e926oGUXfrLt","I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)",198484727,"ab67616d00001e02c84b9bd63074979108c7c752","5780af796e94eb1bc54ac4fd86cb54b1d5c65ca0","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC10301819","RCA/BMG Heritage","1981","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/b271a25a4b6844acaa3385320206cc62.cnvs.mp4"],["5HQ639Z3ms3hnZx0KfWnkp","Private Eyes",171110619,"ab67616d00001e02c84b9bd63074979108c7c752","758f1bae987059714338834f85fbea626f39cd34","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC10301825","RCA/BMG Heritage","1981","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/1333011886a74b0782c2b2a998de21a8.cnvs.mp4"],["1qjrYozGqc7upUgfN776lZ","Sara Smile",218009831,"ab67616d00001e027e0dea0c3a0bf7c6820306c9","6861f471fde52752db1cfedcda3e76c29739cc91","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC17500581","Buddha Records","1975",null],["5dFoWIiJ2814hRwMYDcFiU","She's Gone",144423413,"ab67616d00001e024959f78cc9a050555687c4c2","183d56e80402b878c4fe98dc9426ebc634473814","Warner Music Group","en","USAT20614606","Rhino Atlantic","1973-01-01",null],["7cDzJyC95jtGO9zAeZsWOg","Kiss on My List",115989206,"ab67616d00001e02fe1a9aa59e3c6189a09ae37a","6c0b4229fe4a922b413a464f003172c6a6da4d6c","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC10301820","RCA/BMG Heritage","1980",null],["6pVW5LRWgeLaHudxauOTJU","Jingle Bell Rock - Daryl's Version",334064124,"ab67616d00001e02758f7f6791ee819e6c2999b4","f6d1f547852b4a5cb578afaeeabbc0cf56987a01","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USRC10900416","Legacy Recordings","1983-11-01","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/23450a494d2d4f30ad43619517f9f49b.cnvs.mp4"],["75XQk1ewCddGnDuFMYg2iL","When the Morning Comes",22798711,"ab67616d00001e024959f78cc9a050555687c4c2","c7b00b5ab4348c5967da169231c13f160985362a","Warner Music Group","en","USAT20614603","Rhino Atlantic","1973-01-01",null]]},"topCities":{"fields":["cid","l"],"rows":[[1001,524425],[1004,389007],[1000,341049],[1006,324674],[1019,294202]]},"relatedArtists":["0f3EsoviYnRKTkmayI3cux","3PhoLpVuITZKcymswpck5b","35U9lQaRWSQISxQAB94Meo","4QTVePrFu1xuGM9K0kNXkk","1ThoqLcyIYvZn7iWbj8fsj","6IRouO5mvvfcyxtPDKMYFN","4bthk9UfsYUYdcFyqxmSUU","6zFYqv1mOsgBRQbae3JJ9e","4QQgXkCYTt3BlENzhyNETg","0PFtn5NtBbbUNbU9EAmIWF","6ZNeppgfBLPUyugks9Yn1u","1LZEQNv7sE11VDY3SdxQeN","7tjbDPvrdvDshcpEMXKRVb","3mQBpAOMWYqAZyxtyeo4Lo","08GQAI4eElDnROBrJRGE0X","5NGO30tJxFlKixkPSgXcFE","0TqIPD4IS1w4e30R38B3vj","0rvjqX7ttXeg3mTy8Xscbt","7jefIIksOi1EazgRTfW2Pk","7lzordPuZEXxwt9aoVZYmG"]}
