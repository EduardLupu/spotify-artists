From 2001's quintuple-platinum M!ssundaztood to 2003's Grammy-winning Try This, P!nk steadily made moves away from her early R&B style, teaming with songwriters Linda Perry , Tim Armstrong ( Rancid ), and Butch Walker to give her rousing pop anthems a distinct rock edge.","gallery":["ab6772690000dd22c62cc367f8207c26cac54fa5","cc490cb12ec2c6aa59394a68a0e55bdcb97aa57c","50908df3abc0892036fbb4d7fe5a5a5e9e14ff2b","3bec98d066bc5c513184094e46c3335932639374","38a89ec39d51bfc001464746268df700348f2bc1","a094afdc638bf54caf1080f01ea29f5b2fdef9f8","5db0b0aafeb241db53ad38cb3fdc24652126545d","1f36682b72b4a94b21ff1420a382a7eb9461da4b","ff214af540aa260dbb5aac58333ad760a29cc051","e7979cf3b78ed82584606b23f010e5f9028259de","7c22e6d1f74eddff097790a75e34c16a7511336a","00736fa93e5bc61f61cf936de86f2fa207d99f8a","407c0874323882efab8e4c71e4af6a34baa30740","79cf7e459a6c08e2a2b00f0d3e45cf1c3f15b707","3a085926f067306779ce1d79c13d3e9cddc6d76a","d6dfe7a32d5b92540f37104af103bb9a4f150335","f0f3e03a1529f4498167e98dfa5ca59f46e6c676","34d9515217739805429307818b98d3fc85d80126","e9e19eba636c2bae41d22c6cea51b197e5a32020"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-10-24",34207054,18190541,148],["2025-10-25",34077393,18192856,149],["2025-10-26",33913610,18195419,152],["2025-10-27",33851320,18197804,153],["2025-10-28",33760694,18199686,154],["2025-10-29",33657135,18202794,154],["2025-10-30",33585381,18203604,155]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["1mKXFLRA179hdOWQBwUk9e","Just Give Me a Reason (feat.
