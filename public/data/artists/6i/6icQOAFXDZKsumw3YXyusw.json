Between the release dates of those proper albums for the Quality Control label, Yachty's approach shifted from a reliance upon willfully off-key singing and lackadaisical rhyming to that of a comparatively traditional MC, albeit with his irreverent sense of humor still gamely displayed.","gallery":["ab6761670000ecd44e553cbe5c66a56db30d5249","ab6761670000ecd47bb1bdffd30a213d26789945"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-10-25",14354062,10900554,null],["2025-10-26",14352448,10901999,null],["2025-10-27",14341644,10903231,null],["2025-10-28",14328581,10904457,null],["2025-10-29",14297202,10906136,null],["2025-10-30",14292296,10906718,null],["2025-10-31",14273672,10907844,null],["2025-11-01",14316288,10908688,null],["2025-11-02",14299285,10909894,null]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["6luBKkFUt5wTwz7hpLhp12","drive ME crazy!",211568044,"ab67616d00001e026f578b21bce56056473da7e6","5e79f05a317bc07aeb7cf8e4d0d01d3f54a5d686","Universal Music Group","en","USUG12207176","Quality Control Music/Motown Records","2023-01-27","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/7JGwF0zhX9oItt9901OvB5/video/82161e7cb7154a45977700a884302fe6.cnvs.mp4"],["5Ryu0SlsYjKh78RkJUONFr","Flex Up (feat.
