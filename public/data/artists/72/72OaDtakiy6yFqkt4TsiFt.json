After the smash success of Sonny & Cher 's folk/rock and pop recordings of the '60s and the duo's hit TV show, she scored hits on her own, such as \"Half Breed\" and \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\" in the '70s before switching into disco mode for \"Take Me Home.\" In the '80s, she became an esteemed actress, with lead roles in the highly acclaimed films Mask and Moonstruck (the latter earned her an Oscar).","gallery":["ab6772690000dd22514c2767d9f63c7a0b8b7144","c610c72545ca30de1efd49c6185fffbd9ce26758","41803125e6e1efe2dcbfae59679f7e549ec95e9d","c6fe8750b09b3faceab782c6f43a54fe62b13519","7084a7c0bfd9fa49054b36a891ad046e360c4b22","9c94d06198a9d8b5ff5ab29bc7a00dcdd8aaf428","af5c35e9a95592506f7f6aa82464a3e7c8e403bf","818c3e834eb5ceebc526e618a6cda74718f2d720","3e277dd60b0a03a0bc7266723880991348bd5996","a6271df8d0804f06e0d272bb6979a3e8072eb378","5dba4c8c4b57e24418726e5accf8c029d0406569","335c603d9e86e460d3b6c8bafab7ba869a90ced5","3f6355f1d2a706f129cc91aa7906cda409ab9673","b896d9e2ac12ec1afa1c2c8796c108fe16f53291","0d6cff2e11a14cac9bac5ef2f23f9ed4c0d067a5","ad78f26c713baba9151f61f6c9e8118fabe646ae","f77026ce8bf0c3af30c4e96ddfef98be0852ac7b"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-11-19",12644354,3823698,null]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["2goLsvvODILDzeeiT4dAoR","Believe",867790344,"ab67616d00001e0206ce0d1f846c525e847d60e7","4d1118af5a493275e5c7522aaa26faa34b72d828","Warner Music Group","en","GBAHT9803002","Warner Records","1998","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/8cbfd0795b0f45ea9d684b7f7d8d3816.cnvs.mp4"],["6mYrhCAGWzTdF8QnKuchXM","If I Could Turn Back Time",385447603,"ab67616d00001e027a1e0215c41f0ce411623301","4f598743e67ae843e531007ab29780789899f5df","Universal Music Group","en","USGF18923901","Geffen","1989-01-01",null],["144JMbvbR5txNzoZ112wo4","Strong Enough",179425244,"ab67616d00001e0206ce0d1f846c525e847d60e7","d839454c3df67a75dcbca68c9ad635357571ba3d","Warner Music Group","en","GBAHT9803037","Warner Records","1998","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/11cadd70a6644b1cb0edf8fd536c867b.cnvs.mp4"],["18uSfZqFBxQFi8CsXOIbhy","DJ Play A Christmas Song",69264970,"ab67616d00001e02975b86124c181e9477f0d154","86b8f39b8ea8f8808e2fb6baa46dbf1bd76a4f83","Warner Music Group","en","USWB12304055","Warner Records","2023-10-20","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/489e6465be2b4dfab8e58e2ad9f185c3.cnvs.mp4"],["0ACu78PvVsOFYIKgRkKbGZ","After All (Love Theme From Chances Are)",129285557,"ab67616d00001e027a1e0215c41f0ce411623301","92e9428fc3e880415c1f13026e90f21bbf484af7","Universal Music Group","en","USGF18923912","Geffen","1989-01-01",null],["5oV1YjM2rtyZ55txHHsFUu","The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)",190901055,"ab67616d00001e02401035ff4d67022fa4c0fad0","b131949023a070a4a22c2fe553008bfe33da0e74","Universal Music Group","en","USGF19031001","Geffen","1991-06-11",null],["5JGdpqo9wrRtOZtui5GShI","Just Like Jesse James",66992480,"ab67616d00001e027a1e0215c41f0ce411623301","187611c5e5cbf13019a019b64e2102523dc7c9df","Universal Music Group","en","USGF18923902","Geffen","1989-01-01",null],["6fsSZbNL7XP9gf1kJ2l155","Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves",59422983,"ab67616d00001e028c097583959947d229e0ab2e","34710f870fc92e7ae9bd19a0d23b9e2bf6863153","Universal Music Group","en","USMC17112760","Geffen","1971-01-01",null],["60Pwcnt2y9ML9VP4gwrcxm","Walking in Memphis",104489511,"ab67616d00001e021cafae5c9e0e809317d46a31","9b803006c2c438cbe63261916fc722d7fb70cc2c","Warner Music Group","en","GBAHT9500590","WM UK","1995-11-06","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/6965eeca33044caea3cdb5c391ac9470.cnvs.mp4"],["52DZ8dACtQoSohIn18FBLC","Più che puoi - Remastered 2021",20766755,"ab67616d00001e0290b41d8220dedb9c59dc44e0","2e06a03427ed2b32d61f62dae0838c630c151634","Sony Music Entertainment","it","ITB002100704","Ariola/Hansa Local","2021-10-29","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/artist/61J0BktHv7PuP3tjTPYXSX/video/89ef76c920724654bee713a42c72bc18.cnvs.mp4"]]},"topCities":{"fields":["cid","l"],"rows":[[1001,297701],[1000,228880],[1004,183611],[1007,165655],[1006,162269]]},"relatedArtists":[]}
