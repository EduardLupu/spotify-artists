After the smash success of Sonny & Cher 's folk/rock and pop recordings of the '60s and the duo's hit TV show, she scored hits on her own, such as \"Half Breed\" and \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\" in the '70s before switching into disco mode for \"Take Me Home.\" In the '80s, she became an esteemed actress, with lead roles in the highly acclaimed films Mask and Moonstruck (the latter earned her an Oscar).","gallery":["ab6772690000dd22514c2767d9f63c7a0b8b7144","c610c72545ca30de1efd49c6185fffbd9ce26758","41803125e6e1efe2dcbfae59679f7e549ec95e9d","c6fe8750b09b3faceab782c6f43a54fe62b13519","7084a7c0bfd9fa49054b36a891ad046e360c4b22","9c94d06198a9d8b5ff5ab29bc7a00dcdd8aaf428","af5c35e9a95592506f7f6aa82464a3e7c8e403bf","818c3e834eb5ceebc526e618a6cda74718f2d720","3e277dd60b0a03a0bc7266723880991348bd5996","a6271df8d0804f06e0d272bb6979a3e8072eb378","5dba4c8c4b57e24418726e5accf8c029d0406569","335c603d9e86e460d3b6c8bafab7ba869a90ced5","3f6355f1d2a706f129cc91aa7906cda409ab9673","b896d9e2ac12ec1afa1c2c8796c108fe16f53291","0d6cff2e11a14cac9bac5ef2f23f9ed4c0d067a5","ad78f26c713baba9151f61f6c9e8118fabe646ae","f77026ce8bf0c3af30c4e96ddfef98be0852ac7b"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-11-19",12644354,3823698,null],["2025-11-20",12738355,3824601,null],["2025-11-21",12837939,3825516,null],["2025-11-22",12958571,3826539,null],["2025-11-23",13119862,3827588,null],["2025-11-24",13295439,3828672,null],["2025-11-25",13405831,3829446,null],["2025-11-26",13502348,3830213,null],["2025-11-27",13635439,3831006,null],["2025-11-28",13766734,3831800,null],["2025-11-29",13945965,3832519,null],["2025-11-30",14181950,3833341,null],["2025-12-01",14444478,3834085,null],["2025-12-02",14643709,3834722,null],["2025-12-03",14829459,3835382,null],["2025-12-04",15011817,3836342,null],["2025-12-05",15192500,3837478,null],["2025-12-06",15423934,3838470,null],["2025-12-07",15789083,3839412,null],["2025-12-08",16101683,3840406,null],["2025-12-09",16294051,3841190,null],["2025-12-10",16518121,3841983,null],["2025-12-11",16743743,3842713,null],["2025-12-12",16962815,3843319,null],["2025-12-13",17243426,3843932,null],["2025-12-14",17631869,3844575,null],["2025-12-15",17973536,3845130,null],["2025-12-16",18191320,3845629,null],["2025-12-17",18421019,3846158,491],["2025-12-18",18649108,3846640,481],["2025-12-19",18887126,3847270,477],["2025-12-20",19191536,3847857,464],["2025-12-21",19541086,3848615,447],["2025-12-22",19913191,3849480,435],["2025-12-23",20284137,3850274,425],["2025-12-24",20818315,3850993,413],["2025-12-25",22330559,3851808,371],["2025-12-26",23704829,3852604,336],["2025-12-27",23931475,3853457,334],["2025-12-28",23876220,3854310,334],["2025-12-29",23786155,3855003,335]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["18uSfZqFBxQFi8CsXOIbhy","DJ
