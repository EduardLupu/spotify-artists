These feats built the foundation of a career that boasts six consecutive Top Ten albums, from the diamond Country Grammar (2000) to the platinum 5.0 (2010) and \"The Fix\" (2015), leading to warmly received collaborations in the 2020s.","gallery":["67f24249e5cffd1aa7446195d91110baa90be253","4de7bd3685362de875da896d6fde2d38c4a7cd02","409493522aff4595b02469d1544c519f294d9530","4c6aa4a4b0fddf542073e3af6144de3ac8d41953","4503ba27bc5a64b13a7e2741e3367823a8863c7a","da977c6196183148318351751f85800b87b6218c"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-10-24",22965808,3730152,323],["2025-10-25",22970017,3732152,323],["2025-10-26",22970017,3732152,323]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["0ARK753YaiJbpLUk7z5yIM","Dilemma",1103990499,"ab67616d00001e02a8b9f97b9ea065b9a857e93f","166e4018942f444036157420ef0ba2cb804cc6e5","Universal Music Group","en","USUR10200370","Motown","2002-06-25",null],["3ZdJffjzJWFimSQyxgGIxN","Just A Dream",650389793,"ab67616d00001e02ad198c2dfdaf6b7fdc460df7","ca0bf2f470733491409c38e198bf990b0b437f9d","Universal Music Group","en","USUM71020948","Motown","2010-11-12",null],["3Gf5nttwcX9aaSQXRWidEZ","Ride Wit Me",748565766,"ab67616d00001e02a7ad64a69a42647de9dd0dad","b7babc9e267faa4bc66b9c479bbf96595bf4c33d","Universal Music Group","en","USUR10000183","Motown","2000-06-27",null],["04KTF78FFg8sOHC1BADqbY","Hot In Herre",689641908,"ab67616d00001e02a8b9f97b9ea065b9a857e93f","e3d856695fd100c4c2cf21e6c65fac1e0649cc02","Universal Music Group","en","USUR10200371","Motown","2002-06-25",null],["3wMUvT6eIw2L5cZFG1yH9j","Country Grammar (Hot Shit)",302217905,"ab67616d00001e02a7ad64a69a42647de9dd0dad","477e81c7439a989179b38848490ba915c4edd6b8","Universal Music Group","en","USUR10080452","Motown","2000-06-27",null],["0l7DPAKQVayEz9FXC9di2e","Grillz",182504584,"ab67616d00001e0218e97d0e56772d606512540d","aac05bea44fe479b3a4ce6077e1846f66fd97760","Universal Music Group","en","USUM70505024","Universal Records","2022-10-14",null],["2wDg3GkMpKCNuNLhRJ3ruj","Nasty Girl",245145700,"ab67616d00001e02e7548e3fbe450966946be091","c09a0af883c0358703d1f281a0d7a2b692463baf","Universal Music Group","en","USBB10500071","Motown","2005-11-25",null],["33aow0AcXYvT1FoWNzMcqN","Lil Bit (feat.
