He's one of rock & roll's best interpretive singers, as well as an accomplished, innovative songwriter whose work created a raw, loose, and charming combination of folk, rock, blues, and country.","gallery":["254b97898290ec7c751510e8550ed8e4c635d44d","18804e0646eeab955aa29f9330641a78f1bea291","919e2cf4b37e68d5ecc0c434e4e3892c3addf7c8","ab6772690000dd22e903ddf13478b32faab6697f","ab6772690000dd2258498010e0af5a2ad3ffde7c","8b7abb8fc9cc9bfc77f3abef741a3611f6554cfb","b5a46724c5a763f60a38db8ff4acdb0b25f2ba65","3f7bbabb606c1a80db4cd2f589984b0062a74687","ff932c4413fe1c4d48198d8a43b3aac0903a6163","d8ef7271f6b0e65aeb5806016742a2607e43b457","73db12b2bc1c67b6c93d53dd9ba448f393e59f87","10884c9d784956fc9f3f5838a96b93b990035201","e140950d5723214b3f5c6a8aeb68e503d1cdf32f","c9d0e7115c140ce644d791e49fe8c144a50b1ff4","432fd25d1e5c48cd00b71bc8d483a139706a0fc1","e18159a72ba88998a7f7e98859f1e9eb246982d5","6168b1bc3d05fff566a39ee12650736620af7248","c0cb3bdc265d33921f41e77029102d05300764d2","9c4890dedc4f1102f5fad3111b356907111e64ac","73724b8ef24f8f82b494491ac30ec305273b007f","8bc615f19ff7db35b56351204835047c5c3e6042","a164caaeb70409674402c1346c92647060d64318","1a8e210c8175e5aab04d04f07dfa7eda96af815e","fab02efa743aafa20c648ce5952da66ee9e0d9af","e485b3a9cf155a27e528474951656e58e46326a3"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-10-25",13047527,5554114,null],["2025-10-26",13057416,5555872,null],["2025-10-27",13043353,5557496,null],["2025-10-28",13034261,5558752,null],["2025-10-29",13008052,5560576,null],["2025-10-30",12950919,5561289,null],["2025-10-31",12934317,5562509,null],["2025-11-01",12929586,5563752,null]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["4z7maGZkAonDlXlwo8q69f","Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?",409669340,"ab67616d00001e02d6806ddfc58bbaa0cb3e9fa5","d7c9823901cd954ea4ecdb90f920f422d7238714","Warner Music Group","en","USWB10807926","Rhino/Warner Records","1978-11-24","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/fa949c16113647f09c8634288515f569.cnvs.mp4"],["6rovOdp3HgK1DeAMYDzoA7","Maggie May",400871744,"ab67616d00001e02f20825485137abccd82b9665","0fc64bacd8ebd5b672274d055b374d6318e93881","Universal Music Group","en","USPR37102613","Mercury Records","1971-05-18",null],["1wrT33b6HuKlpk9ziscEUY","Baby Jane - 2008 Remaster",149399247,"ab67616d00001e02bcf214aa282a19326c295e31","9e9afbe3cdc94ccf559398f59858afb48840ac7f","Warner Music Group","en","USWB10806973","Rhino/Warner Records","1983","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/a03d85c62f9c467d93ad9dd3b491e456.cnvs.mp4"],["4lsEHglVsLzILTDQ3CNESV","All for Love",249948837,"ab67616d00001e029b6cec855adacecc6a140f75","97f5e9b0f62cfc4eb93ecae11adc624d2aaf726a","Warner Music Group","en","USWB19600851","Warner Records","1996-11-12",null],["6OuRbvP4PgbuzBIapVzmFJ","Sailing",218427266,"ab67616d00001e02e362eab0b5272915a217e501","d65de04d5248581c72f8a4f1bd39eeb50e3c175e","Warner Music Group","en","USWB10807925","Rhino/Warner Records","1975","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/cb83f99cb85849d789f6f049bfb4ef08.cnvs.mp4"],["6OPi0rUWmRWJhe1BjeOlJb","I Don't Want to Talk About It - 1989 Version",88096291,"ab67616d00001e029b6cec855adacecc6a140f75","93f72bdbdf7f8ed520030a416b434cb1f6b88359","Warner Music Group","en","USWB19600844","Warner Records","1996-11-12",null],["6mIY6O7uNGgVqOoX70UAYh","Have I Told You Lately - 2008 Remaster",164082466,"ab67616d00001e02cf5dca3c5d19ad90c0c61c6b","9a397d5138f5e23b04e77912ecf6c5a9bf05b42b","Warner Music Group","en","USWB10807203","Rhino/Warner Records","1991","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/c01d71f43e8645708d0d718f38ebb94c.cnvs.mp4"],["6sBA8b9bT8Z8G8TkVDvNTK","Young Turks",61772599,"ab67616d00001e02abc644f6ad5483eb22acd51f","f7a81c78c88c754d0b95cf532f151fb2b09bf597","Warner Music Group","en","USWB10807934","Rhino/Warner Records","1981","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/e20f406a05694a84a112966a0f5fc12c.cnvs.mp4"],["2JWKzkQbYsNzx019WyGzaH","I Don't Want to Talk About It - 2008 Remaster",159088814,"ab67616d00001e02e362eab0b5272915a217e501","b138ee402b328f5b144c3bbfa97e6a2659cd836d","Warner Music Group","en","USWB10807379","Rhino/Warner Records","1975","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/07c0deb417cb4c539559dce98c2631e7.cnvs.mp4"],["7f1X6tauagdeqpfNuNOYWr","Have You Ever Seen The Rain",103390083,"ab67616d00001e02873a4f8ba9a77d4393ce58c7","6ddab3743f58e1c556ff07dd7ffe540adaaa1d28","Sony Music Entertainment","en","USJAY0600090","J Records","2006-10-09",null]]},"topCities":{"fields":["cid","l"],"rows":[[1000,575320],[1007,223787],[1002,220243],[1001,200609],[1004,154978]]},"relatedArtists":[]}
