He recently won the ACM Award for Male Artist of the Year and Best Country Solo Performance at the 67th Grammy Awards for “It Takes A Woman,” from his acclaimed album Higher, which features “White Horse” and “Think I'm In Love With You.” Produced by Dave Cobb, Morgane Stapleton and Chris Stapleton, Higher landed on “Best of” lists from Billboard, Esquire, Los Angeles Times, Vulture and Rolling Stone, who call it “dazzling…the best evidence yet for the way one man’s voice has become synonymous with the very idea of a musical genre.” The New Yorker hails him as “the rare country star with both traditional bona fides and broad commercial appeal,” while GQ proclaims, “In an age rife with division, he’s maybe the only thing Americans all agree on.” Known for his electric live performances, Stapleton continues his “All-American Road Show” this summer.","gallery":["c89408463dd4435ed34f0cb0cf11eea8fbf271c9","65453efe4f562fee64036136852ec0d642b56f6c","3f659a3b71b29988cbeff24f975ace59b28596f5","40bf5822b96a92a278be0b7687c81c9d04ff31e3"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-10-24",24295931,9001851,287],["2025-10-25",24310628,9005223,285],["2025-10-26",24315851,9008170,283],["2025-10-27",24288033,9011580,285],["2025-10-28",24292409,9014528,285],["2025-10-29",24290435,9018726,284],["2025-10-30",24281852,9020741,285],["2025-10-31",24235790,9023625,288],["2025-11-01",24188350,9026531,290],["2025-11-02",24105543,9029620,293],["2025-11-03",24039022,9032775,294],["2025-11-04",24019921,9035224,295],["2025-11-05",24003833,9037774,298],["2025-11-06",23983853,9040423,299]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["3fqwjXwUGN6vbzIwvyFMhx","Tennessee
