This combination, which flourished on ballads, made Combs stand apart from both slick country-pop crooners and bro-country revelers, a distinction that helped him become a hit right out of the gate. His first single, 2016's \"Hurricane,\" launched a series of five number one Billboard Country Airplay hits in a row, including \"When It Rains It Pours,\" \"One Number Away,\" \"She Got the Best of Me,\" and \"Beautiful Crazy.\" All were pulled from his 2017 debut album, This One's for You (or its expanded reissue), a period that saw Combs become one of the biggest stars in Nashville.","gallery":["ab6761670000ecd478868870cd936ecafe75bbf2"],"series":{"fields":["d","ml","f","r"],"rows":[["2025-10-24",25793037,13381219,246],["2025-10-25",25755948,13384019,247],["2025-10-26",25731299,13386616,245],["2025-10-27",25705627,13389589,247],["2025-10-28",25650023,13392358,247],["2025-10-29",25587622,13396192,249],["2025-10-30",25550105,13397845,249]]},"topTracks":{"fields":["i","n","pl","img","preview","licensor","language","isrc","label","rd","canvas"],"rows":[["1Lo0QY9cvc8sUB2vnIOxDT","Fast Car",866893019,"ab67616d00001e02ca650d3a95022e0490434ba1","1dc0426c95058783e0fe1d70c41583ca98317108","Sony Music Entertainment","en","US6XF2200436","River House Artists/Columbia Nashville","2023-03-24","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/c04673b8822f41f09d82eec3b80eee8c.cnvs.mp4"],["0eBFgRxyVSeuT4iyrbukdn","Where the Wild Things Are",531351430,"ab67616d00001e02ca650d3a95022e0490434ba1","994c947925dbf67ee0132328c82fb6102e29f746","Sony Music Entertainment","en","US6XF2200441","River House Artists/Columbia Nashville","2023-03-24","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/5bSw7fRotCnRCcO9br14W5/video/e54541fa100846a0be31af8b240b0b8b.cnvs.mp4"],["6GG4yyk3UATdBfTHVgI8PB","Ain't No Love In Oklahoma (From Twisters: The Album)",439857239,"ab67616d00001e0239808230102049beb62fdd7b","7b74f19b964aef85615e635192d4fcd9fbf297d3","Warner Music Group","en","USAT22402805","Atlantic Records","2024-05-16","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/licensor/3ZBqv9LoqAZkFanJh73zcz/video/307e80bdd71c4bec8235f49f764750ec.cnvs.mp4"],["1mMLMZYXkMueg65jRRWG1l","When It Rains It Pours",1158217923,"ab67616d00001e02b7578013decfa174e30dc298","034066bcc59420c96bc025ed2f204ee2cb9c975d","Sony Music Entertainment","en","QZ4751600015","River House Artists/Columbia Nashville","2017-06-02","https://canvaz.scdn.co/upload/artist/718COspgdWOnwOFpJHRZHS/video/35dfebf768334f838d37f7d2a467daa1.cnvs.mp4"],["6BZaRf4Zh9Y07qnELLboGu","Backup Plan (feat.
